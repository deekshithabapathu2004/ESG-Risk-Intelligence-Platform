##  Problem Statement

Static ESG scores are insufficient for risk management. Companies often show **declining ESG performance** or **governance weaknesses** long before they appear in headlines or regulatory filings. Organizations need a **forward-looking, dynamic risk signal** ‚Äî not just a snapshot.

This platform addresses that gap by combining **ESG trends**, **industry benchmarks**, and **financial health indicators** into a unified risk score.

##  Key Results

Using a dataset of **11,001 company-year observations** (2015‚Äì2025) across 10 industries and 8 regions, the platform delivers:

-  **45 high-risk companies** in the Asia region (classified as "Red Zone")  
-  **Avg Governance Score in Red Zone**: **38.2** vs Industry Avg: **52.1** (**27% gap**)  
-  **Top Risk Driver**: Weak governance (73% of Red Zone firms score < 40 in governance)  
-  **Actionable Recommendations**: e.g., *"Improve governance by 14.2 points to reduce risk by 22%"*

---

##  Methodology

### 1. **Risk Scoring Engine**
A composite risk score (0‚Äì100) is engineered using:
- **ESG Trend Volatility** (3-year standard deviation)
- **Industry Benchmark Gap** (vs peer average)
- **Financial Stress Proxy** (declining profit + market cap volatility)
- **Governance Weighting** (critical for investor risk assessment)

### 2. **Risk Segmentation**
K-Means clustering groups companies into:
- **üü¢ Green Leader**: High ESG, stable performance  
- **üü° Yellow Watch**: Medium ESG, declining trend  
- **üî¥ Red Zone**: Low ESG, financial stress, governance gaps

### 3. **Actionable Output**
Each Red Zone company receives a **customized recommendation** based on its risk drivers:
> *‚ÄúClose ESG gap: Improve by 15.2 points to match industry average‚Äù*
